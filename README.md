  * MySQL is a database management system.
    It may be anything from a simple shopping list to a picture gallery or the vast amounts of information in a 
    corporate network. To add, access, and process data stored in a computer database, you need a database management
    system such as MySQL Server

  * Web Applications : Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and   mobile applications.

  * APIs : With a myriad of HTTP utility methods and middleware, creating a robust API is quick and easy.

  * Performance : Express provides a thin layer of fundamental web application features, without obscuring Node.js features.


  **5. [Sequelize](https://Sequelize.com/)** : 

  * Sequelize is a modern TypeScript and Node. js ORM for Postgres, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite and SQL Server, 
    and more. Featuring solid transaction support, relations, eager and lazy loading, read replication and more.


  **6. [Dotenv](https://Dotenv.com/)** :

  * DotEnv is a lightweight npm package that automatically loads environment variables from a . env file into the process.


  **7. [Handlebars](https://Handlebars/)** :

  * Handlebars is a simple templating language. It uses a template and an input object to generate HTML or other text formats. Handlebars templates look like regular text with embedded Handlebars expressions
