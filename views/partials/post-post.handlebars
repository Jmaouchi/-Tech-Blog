{{!-- this partial is almost the same than the post-info partial, the reason i created this, is that i need to hide some data 
on the homepage route --}}
<article class="post">
  <div class="title">
    {{!-- for every sigle post, display the title and the url of that post  --}}
    <a href="/post/{{id}}">{{title}}</a>
    <span>({{format_url post_url}})</span>
  

    {{!-- this will automaticaly send you to the post/id route which is the route where you can view a single comment and can add one if
    you are logged in --}}
    <div class="meta">
      <span class="post--infos"> Created by {{user.username}} on {{format_date created_at}}</span>
      <a href="/post/{{id}}" class="comments-tag">{{comments.length}} {{format_plural "comment" comments.length}}</a>
    </div>
  </div>
</article>
